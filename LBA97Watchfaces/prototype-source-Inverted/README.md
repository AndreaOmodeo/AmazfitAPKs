# Watchface for Amazfit smartwatch

Thanks Malvarez, Marco Fregapane and Dany for their help.

The only prerequisites to compile it are:

* Add the *HuamiWatchFaces* application as a jar dependency into the libs folder (instructions in the main folder)
* Use Android SDK 21

This is the source code for the modded Prototype Source. Some code is taken from Marco Fregapane, and mainly from Malvarez.
Finally the watch face looks like this:
